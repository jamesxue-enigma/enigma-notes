deselecting data science in analytics team when everything selected

cut everything but aggregate view
update aggregate view whenever itâ€™s updated

add additional view: allow to break down the bars by project, not by skill
(aggregate by skill)

add current time, 1month, 3month, 6month projections
wanna see back in time too

toggle a button for real/not real 

instead of axes selection - display options
y-axis 
person or project breakdown
hypothetical mode (real with 0 value, all employees including 0 values)


people view

group by person, not by month
add some whitespace between people
1 table for each person
link to each person on tooltip for main view (add search bar that changes url with query)
get rid of nav stuff
link back to main view (not just the title)
cap months to 3 months in the future
projects and skills might be unnecessary for people list


projects view
add title
each skill on its own project
add max for max number of skills needed across time

columns: 1 for each month
row: 1 for each skill
for each cell, add however many of each skill is needed (both on text and in a bar?), and on hover people that need to be staffed 
be able to edit each cell (maybe an edit mode pencil? or a separate form)
have a search bar as well
